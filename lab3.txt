1. Sean Gerty and Daniel Mao

2.The password in pass.

3.The password is ferry.

4.[dmao1@hopper3 ~]$ time ./crack 1 5 nomatchingpass
this is the target: omatchingpass
this is the salt: no

5. When you increase the threads it moreless multiply by the threads that you add.
For example, if a program takes 1 min with 1 thread, it takes around 30 seconds with 2 threads.

7.The more threads I use, the less time it takes to find the password

8. Maximum hash rate recorded is 79107 hashes/s.

9. 208827064576 hashes

10. 208827064576 hashes divided by 79107 hashes/s = 2639805 seconds

11. 52 characters= 675790113 seconds
    62 characters= 2760060495 seconds
    93 characters= 70737331672 seconds
12. When the threads are activated, sometimes the first character of password goes beyond its range 
even when I specified "if ('a'<= password[0] <='z')

13. I have attempted the first two extra credits.

Extra Credit:
1.Crack the following five-letter password hashes:
abA.g8pU2Iffo = salts
cdfnIXMyMCpPg = salts
efgC/gw8PDKhs = salts
ghLneTdBMxJP. = salts
ijSsXTgIC7QRU = salts
klr7dT7cAODsk = donot
mn4iWfK0m76t6 = skipp 
opjPsgpXaahxM = anyyy
qr6ncfvfqecME = salts

2.Explain why password salts are useful, even if they're not secret
Because if someone steals the passwords form a database, the hacker would need to create a huge dictionary per salt that he encounters
which would make the code for finding each password with its unique salt more time expensive. Therefore, it give also the use an opportunity 
to have the same password but different salts make it seem that the passwords are different when they are encrypted.
