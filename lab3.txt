Extra Credit:
1.Crack the following five-letter password hashes:
abA.g8pU2Iffo = salts
cdfnIXMyMCpPg = salts
efgC/gw8PDKhs = salts
ghLneTdBMxJP. = salts
ijSsXTgIC7QRU = salts
klr7dT7cAODsk = donot
mn4iWfK0m76t6 = skipp 
opjPsgpXaahxM = anyyy
qr6ncfvfqecME = salts

2.Explain why password salts are useful, even if they're not secret
Because if someone steals the passwords form a database, the hacker would need to create a huge dictionary per salt that he encounters
which would make the code for finding each password with its unique salt more time expensive. Therefore, it give also the use an opportunity 
to have the same password but different salts make it seem that the passwords are different when they are encrypted.
